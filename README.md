## Data Cleaning and Manipulation

####  I used power query editor to connect the data sources and applied  diffrent data transformation by previewing and selected transformations to get the required cleaned data.

## Analysis
#### In the project used various advanced Excel functions such as VLOOKUP, PivotTables, and conditional formatting. Excel Formulae were executed to extract relevant data from the Zomato dataset. The resulting data was then used to create interactive dashboards using Different Charts and Visualization Tool providing valuable insights into restaurant industry trends related to location, opening trends, ratings, and price ranges.

#### In the Zomato  analysis dashboard in Power BI serves as a powerful tool for restaurant businesses to gain valuable insights . 

#### In the Tableau  based analysis i created a story line to understand a zomato data in a much simple way.
